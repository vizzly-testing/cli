## [0.0.6] - 2025-10-18

## What's Changed

### Changed
- **Breaking: Screenshot naming format updated** - Screenshot names no longer include viewport suffixes (e.g., `@mobile`, `@desktop`). Instead, viewport information is now stored as properties for better organization and compatibility with file system restrictions.
  - **Before:** `blog/post-1@mobile` (could cause validation errors with slashes)
  - **After:** Name: `blog-post-1`, Properties: `{ viewport: 'mobile', viewportWidth: 375, viewportHeight: 667 }`
  - Path separators (`/` and `\`) are now replaced with hyphens for cleaner, more portable names
  - This change improves compatibility with Vizzly's security validation and enables better grouping in the dashboard

## [0.0.5] - 2025-10-18

## [0.0.4] - 2025-10-12

## What's Changed

### Fixed
- **Fixed CLI options overriding config file values**: Removed default values from Commander options that were preventing `vizzly.config.js` settings from being respected. Now CLI flags like `--full-page`, `--concurrency`, `--headless`, and `--use-sitemap` only override config when explicitly provided
- **Fixed layout/dimension change detection**: Added `failOnLayoutDiff` to properly detect when screenshots have different dimensions, preventing silent failures in visual comparisons
- Added comprehensive tests for CLI option parsing and config merging behavior

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vizzly-testing/cli/compare/static-site/v0.0.3...static-site/v0.0.4

## [0.0.3] - 2025-10-11

## What's Changed

### Changed
- Relaxed peer dependency requirement for `@vizzly-testing/cli` from `^0.9.0` to `>=0.9.0` to prevent npm installation conflicts with newer CLI versions (0.10.x and higher)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vizzly-testing/cli/compare/static-site/v0.0.2...static-site/v0.0.3
